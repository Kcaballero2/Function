Description:

This was a homework assignment given for us to solve. Here is what the homework assignment was for Advanced Java Programming COP-2805C:
"Introduction

We are going to write a function that utilizes generics

Main Function

Create an array of String, Integer and Double
String[] colors = {"Red","Green","Blue"};
Integer[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};
Double[] circleRadius = {3.0, 5.9, 2.9};
Pass each to the min() function that you are writing and print the output:
Example: System.out.println(min(colors));
Will output “Blue”
Regardless of type, your function will find the minimum
String, Integer and Double already extend Comparable"

Output should be:
Colors: Blue
Numbers: 1
Circle Radius: 2.9
